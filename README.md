> A **Swiss holiday calendar** for AI agents — **public holidays, school holidays and long weekends** for all 26 cantons, with cross-cantonal comparison. School holidays are differentiated by *Schulart* (school type), which matters more than it first appears. No API key required.

[🇩🇪 Deutsche Version](README.de.md)

## Overview

**swiss-holidays-mcp** is a Swiss holiday calendar for AI assistants like Claude — **public holidays, school holidays and long weekends** for all 26 cantons, no API keys required. Public holidays are cantonal (Berchtoldstag, Fronleichnam & co. differ by canton, not just the federal minimum). School holidays are set cantonally, sometimes at district level, and — in six cantons — **separately per school type**. A single federal calendar does not exist; anyone planning across cantonal borders is otherwise reduced to opening 26 PDF pages.

The server covers two thematic clusters: **public holidays / long weekends** and **school holidays** (with *Schulart* differentiation). Each cluster maps to a group of purpose-built tools that translate raw agency data into clean, provenance-tagged JSON responses. All data comes from the [OpenHolidays API](https://www.openholidaysapi.org/) (CC BY 4.0) and [Nager.Date](https://date.nager.at/) (MIT).

> **Mnemonic:** *A duplicate in Swiss school data is usually a school type in disguise.* The underlying API publishes the *same* holiday period several times when a canton differentiates by school type. That looks like duplicated data and invites naive de-duplication — which would destroy exactly the distinction a school authority needs.

**Anchor demo query:** *"In which weeks of 2026 are the compulsory schools of Zurich, Zug and Aargau simultaneously on holiday — and how many overlapping days does each pair share?"*
→ This exercises `find_common_free_window`, `compare_school_holidays` and `list_school_types` in a single conversation, and answers a question that recurs every planning cycle in inter-cantonal coordination.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Data Source |
|---|---|---|
| `list_cantons` | The 26 cantons with ISO codes and official languages | OpenHolidays |
| `list_school_types` | *Schulart* groups per canton (`CH-ZH-VS` etc.) | OpenHolidays |
| `get_school_holidays` | School holidays for one canton and date range | OpenHolidays |
| `get_public_holidays` | Public holidays for one canton and year | OpenHolidays |
| `get_local_holidays` | Public holidays for one municipality or district, incl. local specifics | OpenHolidays |
| `check_date` | Is a given date a school or public holiday? | OpenHolidays |
| `compare_school_holidays` | Pairwise overlap matrix across cantons | OpenHolidays |
| `find_common_free_window` | Windows where all listed cantons are on holiday | OpenHolidays |
| `next_school_holidays` | The next upcoming holiday periods | OpenHolidays |
| `get_long_weekends` | Long weekends and required bridge days | Nager.Date |

### Resources

| Resource URI | Content |
|---|---|
| `holidays://{canton}/{year}` | Markdown summary of all public + school holidays, e.g. `holidays://CH-ZH/2026` |

All tools carry the full annotation set — `readOnlyHint: true`, `destructiveHint: false`, `idempotentHint: true`, `openWorldHint: true` (they reach an external API). No tool writes anywhere. Inputs are schema-validated (canton codes against the 26 known cantons, dates as `YYYY-MM-DD`, `year` bounded, `language`/`school_type` whitelisted).

### Example Use Cases

|---|---|
| *"Which cantons are there, and what are their codes?"* | `list_cantons` |
| *"Show Zurich's compulsory-school holidays for spring 2026"* | `get_school_holidays` |
| *"Is 3 April 2026 a public holiday in Ticino?"* | `check_date` |
| *"Do Zurich and Zug school holidays overlap this year?"* | `compare_school_holidays` |
| *"When can all of ZH, ZG, AG plan a joint week off school?"* | `find_common_free_window` |

## 🛡️ Safety & Limits

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Access** | Read-only (`readOnlyHint: true`) — the server cannot modify or delete any data |
| **Personal data** | No personal data — all sources are aggregated, public holiday calendars |
| **Caching** | 12-hour in-memory TTL (holiday tables change a handful of times per year) |
| **Retry** | Exponential backoff 2s / 4s / 8s; 4xx except 429 are not retried |
| **Timeout** | 20 seconds per API call (8 seconds for health probes) |
| **Authentication** | No API keys required — both upstreams are publicly accessible |
| **Degradation** | Upstream failure yields a `degraded` envelope with an explanatory `note`, never a silent empty list |
| **Terms of Service** | Subject to the ToS of the respective data sources: [OpenHolidays](https://www.openholidaysapi.org/), [Nager.Date](https://date.nager.at/) |

## Architecture

This server uses **Architecture A (live API only, with in-memory cache)**.

```
                    ┌──────────────────────────┐
   Claude / any ───▶│  swiss-holidays-mcp      │
   MCP host         │  (FastMCP · 13 tools)    │

                             │  retry 2s/4s/8s · 12h cache
                    ┌────────┴─────────┐

          OpenHolidays API        Nager.Date
          (CC BY 4.0)             (MIT)
          cantons · Schularten    long weekends
          school + public         bridge days
```

**Rationale (verified live on 2026-07-19):**

- All ten documented OpenHolidays endpoints answered HTTP 200 with plausible payloads; `/Subdivisions?countryIsoCode=CH` returns exactly 26 cantons, matching the official count.
- No public bulk dump could be verified at build time (`openpotato/openholidays.data` raw access returned 404), so Architecture B was not available.
- Holiday tables change a handful of times per year, so a 12-hour in-memory TTL removes almost all upstream load without risking staleness.

**Consequences:**

- Every response carries `provenance` (`live_api` | `cached` | `degraded`).
- Upstream failure yields a `degraded` envelope with an explanatory `note`, never a silent empty list.
- `source_status` always returns an evaluable health report.

## Live-probe findings (2026-07-19)

| Endpoint | HTTP | Status | Records | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/Countries` | 200 | ✅ works | 36 | |
| `/Subdivisions?countryIsoCode=CH` | 200 | ✅ works | 26 | matches official canton count |
| `/Groups?countryIsoCode=CH` | 200 | ✅ works | 11 | *Schulart* groups, only 6 cantons |
| `/PublicHolidays` (CH, 2026) | 200 | ✅ works | 39 | cantonal scope included |
| `/SchoolHolidays` (CH, 2026) | 200 | ✅ works | 193 | 183 distinct after school-type split |
| `/SchoolHolidaysByDate` | 200 | ✅ works | – | |
| `/SchoolHolidays?countryIsoCode=XX` | 200 | ⚠️ silently empty | 0 | invalid country ≠ error |
| `/Subdivisions?languageIsoCode=ZZ` | 200 | ⚠️ silent EN fallback | 26 | invalid language ≠ error |
| `/SchoolHolidays` without date range | 400 | ✅ correct error | – | RFC 9110 problem+json |
| Nager `/PublicHolidays/2026/CH` | 200 | ✅ works | 33 | 29 rows carry `counties` |
| Nager `/LongWeekend/2026/CH` | 200 | ✅ works | 3 | |
| Nager `/PublicHolidays/2026/XX` | 404 | ✅ correct error | – | stricter than OpenHolidays |

### Known findings

1. **Apparent duplicates are school types.** Zurich returns *Frühlingsferien 2026* twice: once for `CH-ZH-VS` (Volksschulen, tagged `Recommended`) and once for `CH-ZH-BS` + `CH-ZH-MS` (Berufsfach- and Mittelschulen). Use the `school_type` parameter (`VS` / `MS` / `BS` / `EO`) rather than de-duplicating.
2. **Only six cantons differentiate** by school type (AI, AR, BE, GR, SO, ZH). Elsewhere `groups` is absent and one table covers everything. The filter therefore treats an absent `groups` field as "applies to all".
3. **Subdivision codes mix levels.** Records may carry `CH-AI-AP` or `CH-BE-TH-BL`. Always match on the `CH-XX` prefix, never on string equality.
4. **An empty list is not an answer.** An unknown country or canton code yields HTTP 200 with `[]`. This server sets an explanatory `note` so that "no holidays" and "bad filter" stay distinguishable.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) / uvx (recommended) or pip
- Internet access (both APIs are publicly available)

---

## Installation

Run via [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)'s `uvx` — no clone or manual install needed:

```bash
uvx swiss-holidays-mcp
```

### Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/malkreide/swiss-holidays-mcp
cd swiss-holidays-mcp
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

---

## Configuration

### Claude Desktop

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "swiss-holidays": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["swiss-holidays-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop — the server starts automatically on first use.

### Cloud Deployment (SSE / Streamable HTTP for browser access)

For use via **claude.ai in the browser** (e.g. on managed workstations without local software):

```bash
MCP_TRANSPORT=sse PORT=8000 python -m swiss_holidays_mcp
```

FastMCP exposes SSE at `/sse`, not `/mcp`.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MCP_TRANSPORT` | `stdio` | Transport: `stdio`, `sse`, `streamable-http` (aka `http`) |
| `PORT` / `MCP_PORT` | `8000` | Port for HTTP transports |
| `MCP_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address for HTTP transports. Loopback by default; `0.0.0.0` is opt-in and logs a warning — run behind an authenticating reverse proxy. |
| `MCP_CORS_ORIGINS` | *(empty)* | Comma-separated extra CORS origins for browser clients (audit SDK-004). Loopback origins are always allowed; add the public origin your UI is served from, e.g. `https://ui.example.ch`. Never `*`. |

The HTTP transports attach an explicit CORS layer that exposes the
`Mcp-Session-Id` header, so a browser MCP client can read the session id and
make follow-up requests. The allow-list is never a wildcard.

> 💡 *"stdio for the developer laptop, SSE for the browser."*

## Lifecycle Phase

This server is in **Phase 1 (read-only)** — all tools read-only, no auth, no side
effects. The 13-tool budget (of the 15–20 recommended maximum) still leaves
headroom. Local and municipal specifics — including Zurich's Sechseläuten and
Knabenschiessen — are covered directly from OpenHolidays via `get_local_holidays`
(a live probe showed they are published upstream at Gemeinde level), so no
separate city data source is required for them.

---

## MCP Primitives & Protocol Version

- **Primitives — Tools + Resources.** The 13 tools are idempotent,
  side-effect-free `GET`s. A **Resource** exposes a stable URI feed
  (`holidays://<canton>/<year>`) so clients can read a canton's calendar as
  cacheable context without a tool call. There are no recurring templated
  workflows, so **Prompts** are not used (revisited if that changes).
- **MCP protocol version.** Built and tested against protocol version
  `2025-06-18` (pinned as `MCP_PROTOCOL_VERSION` and surfaced by `source_status`).
  The wire version is negotiated by the pinned `mcp` SDK (`mcp>=1.2.0,<2`).
- **Update policy.** SDK and dependency bumps land via Dependabot (weekly);
  protocol-version or tool-definition changes are recorded in
  [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) with a version bump.

## Data classification

All data is **Öffentlich / Public Open Data** — aggregated holiday calendars,
no personal data (DSG/DSGVO). This is the highest classification the server
handles; the full model is in [`docs/security.md`](docs/security.md).

## Known Limitations

- **Unofficial source.** OpenHolidays aggregates cantonal publications. For legally binding dates, the cantonal authority remains authoritative. Every response says so.
- **Municipal coverage depends on the upstream.** OpenHolidays does carry district- and municipality-level public holidays (e.g. Sechseläuten, Knabenschiessen at `CH-ZH-ZH-ZH`), exposed through `get_local_holidays`. Completeness at Gemeinde level is only as good as the upstream data, which varies by canton. Municipal *school* holidays are not separately modelled.
- **Nager long weekends ignore cantonal holidays.** They are computed from nationwide holidays only.
- **No historical depth guarantee.** Coverage of years before roughly 2020 is uneven.

# Live smoke tests (hits the real upstream APIs)
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/ -m "live"

# Linting
ruff check src/ tests/

## Deployment for Swiss Public Administration

If you self-host this server for a Swiss school authority or municipal use case:

- **Data residency:** the query patterns themselves (which cantons a civil servant compares) may reveal ongoing planning and are best kept on Swiss or trusted infrastructure.
- **Upstream calls** go to OpenHolidays (EU-hosted OGD project) and Nager.Date. No personal data leaves your environment; only holiday calendars are requested.
- **Logging:** logs are written to stderr; configure your IT retention policy accordingly.
- **HTTP transport** should run behind a reverse proxy with authentication and per-IP rate limits — the server has no built-in authentication.
